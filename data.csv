1,mitnachtKAUBO-I,10,"Hands down my favorite new game of BGG CON 2007.  We played it 5 times in a row -- it's just that good.  Too bad Pandemic won't be in stores until January of 2008.  If you like pure coÃ¶p games (Lord of the Rings, Feurio, etc.), this should be right up your alley.  Having 5 roles to choose from gives the game some extra variability.  Also, once you get good you can ramp up the difficulty by adding more Epidemic cards.  9 -> 10",30549,Pandemic
2,avlawn,10,"I tend to either love or easily tire of co-op games.  Pandemic joins Knizia's LoTR as my favorite true co-op.  It edges LoTR out merely in time to set-up and play.  LoTR can be an undertaking to explain enough details so that players enjoy their first time through the game, while Pandemic is fast enough that even if the players don't quite get everything that is going on, they can try again immediately.",30549,Pandemic

4,Mease19,10,"This is an amazing co-op game.  I play mostly with my wife and this is a game that I can't really imagine getting tired of.  Win or lose, I usually want to play again immediately.  On the Brink and the fan-made expansion from on ArtsCow add much more variety and good game play, only enhancing an already great game.",30549,Pandemic
5,cfarrell,10,"Hey! I can finally rate this game I've been playtesting on and off for a couple years. I really like Pandemic, it's the best cooperative game I've played since Lord of the Rings. The key is in the pacing; the game successfully ratchets up the tension as infections spread and outbreaks pop up all over the place, and the players fight a race against time to conquer the various diseases. The game is just a perfect length, about 45 minutes, and the endgame tension is just right - the game doesn't end before it's over. The different roles give the players significantly different prisms through which to look at the game, which is helpful in cleanly driving table-talk and discussion without phony artificial restrictions like Shadows over Camelot had. All in all, this is finally another good cooperative game that gamers can enjoy. It's not as deep as Lord of the Rings, but it's also simpler and shorter and should be accessible to a wide variety of players.  Gamers should probably bypass the ""easy"" game and go straight to the standard game.  If you'd like to tweak the difficulty a little bit without going straight to Heroic level (which can be pretty tough) try starting the infection rate marker on the second or third space.",30549,Pandemic

8,gregd,10,Love it- great fun with my son. 2 plays so far and looking forward to more!,30549,Pandemic
9,calbearfan,10,"Fun, fun game. Strategy is required, but definitely accessible to non-gamers. Have played it 2 player with my 5 1/2 year old son (using 4 roles and open hands), and he thinks it is his favorite game now. Played it 3 player with my son and my 8 year old daughter, and it was great too. Also very much enjoyed a solitaire game playing 3 roles. This will definitely be one of the most played games for the next few months. I originally rated this a 9.5, but I can't figure out why I took off half a point.",30549,Pandemic

16,zunyer,10,"A thematic, brisk game that is well balanced and creates palpable tension. Currently, (and for the foreseeable future to be honest) my favorite board game. A wonderful addition to my collection, and possibly most collections.",30549,Pandemic
17,Noogs,10,"When this game first came out I followed it closely.  I even listened to a Google Talk that the designer of the game gave.  Honestly, I didn't get it.  I couldn't tell if it was just another one of these co-ops that ends up being *essentially* ""Go Fish"" (e.g., Lord of the Rings, Shadows over Camelot).  Also, there were reviewers who were writing that every play was obvious and mechanical.  Well, I played this for the first time at GenCon '09.  Z-Man had sold out by the end of Saturday, so I bought a copy as soon as I got home.  It's that kind of game.  In ease of rules to interesting outcomes, I'd rate it similarly to Ticket to Ride.  The rules are incredibly simple, and very, very tight.  What the rules don't capture, though is that ambiguous dimension of tension.  Some games are able to produce it, some aren't.  Pandemic's the latter.  This was true of a bunch of adults (at GenCon), and has been true with my two daughters (11 and 14).  It's a similar feeling to Twilight Struggle: you never have control over the board, and things can deteriorate very, very quickly.  Me, I like that kind of game, and I'd rank this as the best pure co-op that I've played so far.  Finally, it is simple enough that my daughters have pulled it out on their own when their friends have come over.  I think Z-Man has got a ""classic"" on its hands here. ",30549,Pandemic

20,xandryyte,10,Thank you BGG SS 2011  Tried this game at PrezCon 08 on Saturday.  It's a co-op game which appealed to me because it's nice to play different types of games.  I enjoyed it very much and I hope I get another chance to play it again soon!,30549,Pandemic

27,Csigs,10,"Right now it's a nine, but I'm close to moving it up to 10.  My experience with cooperative games is that they lose their excitement after a time and the ratings dip ... but this one is starting at a very high point.  Tense, short and fraught with peril ... Pandemic is one of the best theme-to-game marriages that I've come across.",30549,Pandemic

30,kq76,10,"best with 4 players; recommended 1-4 players  I love this game. I just wish there was a version where you played with random cities each game, maybe even a sci-fi version. Still, when asked what my favourite board game is, Pandemic is the first game that comes to mind.",30549,Pandemic
31,macls29,10,"Pre-order: Boards & Bits  I actually have the urge to do something I've never done before on BGG - rate a game before I've played it.  That's how pumped up I am for this one!  Got it today (2/20/08).  I opened it up and the components look fantastic.  I'm going to count the cards as suggested by another BGG user.  Then... time to save the world!  UPDATE:  I had a similar problem with the cards - 2 player cards for St. Petersburg, none for San Franscisco.  I will email Zev to rectify.  I played my first game, and it was amazing!  Tense, fun - I won on my last turn.  I played solo with the Ops Expert and Scientist, at the Intro level.  Very fun!  I'd say it was as tense as LotR, with a more satisfying theme (but then again I am a physician).  I will introduce my wife to it tomorrow - she saw it laid out an was interested, which is a rarity.  I will update how the couples play goes.",30549,Pandemic

36,mjrobertson,10,An all time classic. Played many more times than I have recorded here.,30549,Pandemic
37,jody,10,"The best co-op game in our collection, hands down!  Placing the shuffled Infection Discard pile on top of the remaining Infection Draw pile adds quite a bit of angst to this game by giving the appearance of a relentless repeat epidemic in previously infected cities.  I like the option of determining game level during set-up with the player Draw pile too.  At the moment we're having quite a bit of fun with this, both as 2 & 3-player games.

58,kilroy_locke,10,"An excellent game that captures its theme very well.  Players work together to cure all four major diseases before they destroy the world's population.  Pandemic is very challenging but still fun, and can accomodate from 1-4 players.  There is a nice balance between the different abilities, and the infection mechanic is just brilliant.  It's also highly replayable and quick, usually finishing in around 20-35 minutes.  It's the best game of 2008, and one of my only perfect 10's! ",30549,Pandemic

I have not had one game where someone said ""hey, this is a grey rules area...."" because it is all so simple and clear.  But the game is anything but easy.  Some games, we get blasted in 15 minutes while others go right down to the wire and we win or lose by a thread.  Tense, fun and highly addictive.  Since it plays in 45 mins (max), people always want to keep playing until they win.  And everyone who plays with me seems to run out and buy it.  This is one of the best games I have ever played and I have played quite a lot.  Give it a shot if you have not already done so.",30549,Pandemic

Rating after a few plays. Will revise when played more.  Played about 12 times now and my rating has not lowered. Although I do find that I don't want to play time after time, I do still find that I enjoy it each time. Finally beat it on hard level with two players. It was very satisfying.  OK, this has his a 10 for me. Every game has been enjoyable and its playability for me is fantastic.   2.20.14 Taught this to more new people.

It's nice to have a fairly deep cooperative game that plays in 30-45 minutes. It is actually just as fun to lose as it is to win.  UPDATE: After 8 games I'm just about ready to give this a 10 and move it high up on my top 10 list, but I'm going to wait until I play a couple more time. Excellent game.   UPDATE: OK, after a few more plays I'm giving this a 10 and putting it in my top 10.

236,cfarrell,10,"THE classic game of the 90's. Belongs in every game collection. I still play this fairly often - just the basic game alone has surely cracked 100 plays, and throw in all the variants and expansions and this is an incredible system. --- Version Notes: Overall, I think the 2005-ish re-issue of Die Siedler von Catan from Kosmos - featuering plastic pieces - is the most attractive, funcational version of the game. It has bright, pleasing graphics, the smaller resource cards are easy to manage, and the plastic inserts are the most functional inserts ever for a game. It is in German, though. But every version has its charms, even going back to the borderline-ugly Mayfair 1st and 2nd printings (the ones that used photos - I don't actually own either of those printings, but I'd like to just to add to my collection). The 2007 Mayfair edition (the bigger box) is probably the nicest version that Mayfair has done, and is comparable and even superior in some ways to the 2005 Kosmos edition, the first time Mayfair has gone their own way  and done something at least as good as Kosmos. It also has the advantage of being in English. I generally like Mayfair's 3rd printing better than most players - I think it's a nice, distinct set with its own flavor apart from the other versions - but I'd also agree that it's overall not as graphically effective as the other versions, being a little dark.",13,Catan

Yes, there's a certain ammount of luck (I once won a game becuase the dice simply WOULD NOT stop coming up 4's. Guess who had 4) but it's usually up to the individual players as to what use they make out of their resources. An real winner. ",13,Catan

Also the subject reponds of one's desire: everyone wants to seek their fortune in the unexplored world. We've played once with ten players with two games and a 5&6 player expansion. Great fun.,13,Catan
